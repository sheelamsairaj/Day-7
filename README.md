This repository contains the documentation and deliverables for Task 7 of the Cyber Security Internship provided by Elevate Labs.


🎯 Objective

The objective of this task was to learn how to spot and remove potentially harmful browser extensions to enhance browser security.


🛠️ Tools Used

Google Chrome (or the browser you used) 

System Documentation (Markdown/Text File)

📋 Deliverables

The primary deliverable is the documented process and a list of any suspicious or unnecessary extensions found and removed.

📝 Documented Steps Taken
I followed the provided mini-guide  to audit my browser extensions:

Opened the Browser's Extension Manager: I navigated to the extension management page in [Specify your browser, e.g., Google Chrome via chrome://extensions/].

Reviewed All Installed Extensions: I went through the entire list of installed extensions.

Checked Permissions and Reviews: For each extension, I clicked to view its detailed permissions and checked its reviews/ratings on the official store (if applicable). I paid close attention to permissions like "Read and change all your data on all websites."

Identified Unused/Suspicious Extensions: I flagged extensions that were either no longer necessary or had excessive permissions for their stated function.

Removed Suspicious or Unnecessary Extensions: I uninstalled the flagged extensions.

Restarted Browser: I closed and reopened the browser to confirm stability and performance improvements.

Researched Malicious Extensions: I conducted research on how malicious extensions operate and the risks they pose, such as data theft or injecting ads.
